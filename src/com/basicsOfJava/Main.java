// package in java is used to group related classes
//every java program has a basic structure consist of functions and classes
//function-----> think it of a plumber ie do a specific work
//classes------> group of functions ie household repair in which plumber,electrician etc. will come
//classes are the templates for creating objects

package com.basicsOfJava;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //static makes it possible for us to run these functions without creating an object of the class
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
